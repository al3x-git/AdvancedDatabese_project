Social Life issue:
This full stack application i build with the help of python high level web framework Django. 
I also used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for designing my application.

firstly you need to set up python and its ide in your pc after that 
you need to install its requirements.txt file by using below command onto your terminal. 
[note: enter the command inside the quotes. dont include quotes ].
